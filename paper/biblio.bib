  abstract = {In order to promote computer Go and stimulate fur- ther development
	and research in the field, the event activities, Computational Intelligence
	Forum andWorld 9 9 Computer Go Championship, were held in Taiwan.
	This study focuses on the in- vited games played in the tournamentTaiwaneseGoPlayersVersus
	the Computer Program MoGo held at the National University of Tainan
	(NUTN), Tainan, Taiwan. Several Taiwanese Go players, including one
	9-Dan (9D) professional Go player and eight am- ateur Go players,
	were invited by NUTN to play against MoGo from August 26 to October
	4, 2008. The MoGo program combines all-moves-as-first (AMAF)/rapid
	action value estimation (RAVE) values, online â€œupper confidence
	tree (UCT)-likeâ€? values, offline values extracted from databases,
	and expert rules. Additionally, four properties of MoGo are analyzed
	including: 1) the weakness in corners, 2) the scaling over time,
	3) the behavior in handicap games, and 4) the main strength of MoGo
	in contact fights. The results reveal that MoGo can reach the level
	of 3 Dan (3D) with: 1) good skills for fights, 2) weaknesses in corners,
	in particular, for â€œsemeaiâ€? situations, and 3) weaknesses in
	favorable situations such as handicap games. It is hoped that the
	advances in AI and com- putational power will enable considerable
	progress in the field of computer Go, with the aim of achieving the
	same levels as com- puter Chess or Chinese Chess in the future.},

	seemingly different terminology and methods. The methods are divided
	into three major categories: methods with a priori articulation of
	preferences, methods with a posteriori articulation of preferences,
	and methods with no articulation of preferences. Genetic algorithms
	are surveyed as well. Commentary is provided on three fronts, concerning
	the advantages and pitfalls of individual methods, the different
	classes of methods, and the field of MOO as a whole. The Characteristics
	of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn
	that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering
	problems. It is found that no single approach is superior. Rather,
	the selection of a specific method depends on the type of information
	that is provided in the problem, the user's preferences, the solution
	requirements, and the availability of software.}},
