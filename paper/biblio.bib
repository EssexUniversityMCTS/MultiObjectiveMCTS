  abstract = {{A survey of current continuous nonlinear multi-objective optimization
	(MOO) concepts and methods is presented. It consolidates and relates
	seemingly different terminology and methods. The methods are divided
	into three major categories: methods with a priori articulation of
	preferences, methods with a posteriori articulation of preferences,
	and methods with no articulation of preferences. Genetic algorithms
	are surveyed as well. Commentary is provided on three fronts, concerning
	the advantages and pitfalls of individual methods, the different
	classes of methods, and the field of MOO as a whole. The Characteristics
	of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn
	that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering
	problems. It is found that no single approach is superior. Rather,
	the selection of a specific method depends on the type of information
	that is provided in the problem, the user's preferences, the solution
	requirements, and the availability of software.}},
